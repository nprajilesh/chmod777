chmod is a linux command which is the abbreviation of change mode. It is used manually  change the  permission of a file

a file permmission determines wheter a class **(owner/group/others)** can perform an action **(read/write/execute)**

Different classes 
 * **owner**  determines the user  
 * **group** determines the group
 * **others** any user who is not owner and doesn't belongs to group

Different Permissions

**Execute** ability to run the file as an executable program
**Write** ability to modify the contents of the file
**Read** ability to open and view the content 

each class has a file permission which can be displayed using numeric notation

file permissions are defined as follows
 * **0** – no permission allowed
 * **1** – can execute
 * **2** – can write
 * **4** – can read

 we can generate octal numbers for each group as a combination of these file permissions

| Notation 	|  Permission	|
|---	|---	|
| 0 	|  No Permission	|
| 1 	|  Execute	|
|  2	|  	Write|
| 3 (1+2) 	| Execute and Write 	|
| 4 	|  Read	|
| 5 (1+4)	|  Execute and Read	|
| 6  (2+4)	|  	Read and Write|
|7 (1+2+4)| Read Write and Execute|



Examples:
* ***chmod 600***  – owner can read and write
* ***chmod 700***   – owner can read, write and execute
* ***chmod 666***  – all can read and write

## What Does Chmod 777 Mean?

Setting file permission to 777 means any one can do read,write and execute the file. This can be a security risk since anyone who has access to the system can do anything with the file
